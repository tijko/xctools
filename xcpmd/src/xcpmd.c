/* Xen extended power management support provides HVM guest power management
 * features beyond S3, S4, S5.  For example, it helps expose system level
 * battery status and battery meter information and in future will be extended
 * to include more power management support.  This extended power management
 * support is enabled by setting xen_extended_power_mgmt to 1 or 2 in the HVM
 * config file.  When set to 2, non-pass through mode is enabled which heavily
 * relies on this power management daemon to glean battery information from
 * dom0 and store it xenstore which would then be queries and used by qemu and
 * passed to the guest when appropriate battery ports are read/written to.
